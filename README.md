# PomoDo (Todo list with pomodoro)
This is my first babysteps project in to the world of frontend development in general and Angular in particular.

I am a longtime fan of the [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) productivity technique and used it to force myself through thesis writing. I am also a big fan of [trello]I tend to use it as a todolist as well, so thought I might try to combine them.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.

# hosting

You can deploy a live version of Angular-based apps to github pages. I do this with `ng deploy --base-href=/pomodoro/`. You can see the app running live [here](https://jnewth.github.io/pomodoro/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
