# Pomodoro
This is my first babysteps project in to the world of frontend development in general and Angular in particular.

I am a longtime fan of the pomodoro productivity framework and used it to force myself through thesis writing. I tend to use it as a todolist as well, so thought a good project would be combining them. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
